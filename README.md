## Description
- This project was designed to help us further our understading of jQuery and JavaScript by creating a daily work planner that allows the user to plan out the work day. 

- The goals of this project are as follows: 
- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down,THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
